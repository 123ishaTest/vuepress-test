Welcome to the Incremental Game Template.</p><p>My name is Isha. I have been developing incremental games since 2014. Most of them bad, some of them good.</p><p>Over the years I have developed certain features over and over for different games. Currencies, Upgrades, Statistics and such. This project aims to develop the &#39;final&#39; version of these features, such that everyone can take advantage of them.</p><h2 id="what-is-this-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-this-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is this project</h2><p>To gain the most out of this project, it is important to know what it is about exactly. It is a library of useful scripts that work well together, combined into a single project. You can consume this library and extend some classes to have a working game very quickly. You can also manually copy snippets and apply them to your own project, with some modifications.</p><p>I expect you to be familiar with web development, as well as TypeScript, as I won&#39;t take the time to explain these things.</p><h4 id="it-is" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#it-is" aria-hidden="true">#</a> It is</h4><ul><li>A collection of useful scripts that will help you develop more quickly</li><li>A library you can easily integrate with your favourite frontend framework</li><li>Inspiration for how to implement features every game needs</li><li>Pretty neat</li></ul><h4 id="it-is-not" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#it-is-not" aria-hidden="true">#</a> It is not</h4><ul><li>A tutorial on how to develop webgames</li><li>A game engine</li><li>A guarantee for a good game.

I use them as much as possible to refer to objects.</li><li>JS getters are useful if a method perform very little logic and should be treated as an attribute.</li><li>JS setters are very confusing.</li><li>There should be absolutely no presentation logic mixed with game logic.</li><li>Features presented here should not depend on each other if possible.
